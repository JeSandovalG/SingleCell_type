Optimizing Cell Type Classification Using Deep Learning and Traditional Models

1️ Data Selection & Preprocessing
Choosing Imbalanced Datasets
Select datasets with imbalanced distributions of cell types (use cases where minority classes exist).
Consider datasets where reducing the number of cell types is possible.
Reducing Data Points
Data Distillation: Reduce dataset size while preserving essential patterns.
Sampling Strategy:
Stratified Sampling: Ensure proportions of each cell type remain balanced.
GeoSketch (GeoSketch): An efficient sampling method for scRNA-seq data.
Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering
UMAP for visualization: Reduce dimensionality before clustering.
Clustering Methods:
Leuven & Leiden: Common algorithms for clustering cells before model training.
No need to annotate datasets: Use pre-annotated datasets.

2️ Model Implementation
Gradient-Boosted Trees (XGBoost)
Use XGBoost (XGBoost Docs).
Ensure stratified data splitting to keep class proportions.
Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Model Design
Tune key parameters:
Dropout rate (prevents overfitting).
Learning rate (controls step size of weight updates).
Number of layers (determines depth of the model).
Number of neurons per layer (controls model complexity).
Regularization techniques (L1, L2 penalties to prevent overfitting).
Hyperparameter Optimization
Use Optuna (Optuna Docs) to find optimal DNN hyperparameters.
Data Splitting & Handling Imbalance
Juan knows this part: Juan should implement the stratified split for training and validation.
Apply class weighting to address imbalanced data.

3️ Model Training & Monitoring
Logging & Performance Tracking
Neptune.ai (Neptune Docs): Track model trends and logs.
TensorBoard (TensorFlow TensorBoard): Visualize model performance over time.
PyTorch Lightning (PyTorch Lightning GitHub): Standardized training framework for PyTorch models.
Training Process
Epochs: One full pass over the entire dataset.
Mini-Batches: Model trains in small batches to improve stability.
Backpropagation: The model updates weights after each batch.
Validation Checkpoints: Monitor performance on validation data per epoch.

4️ Tools & Libraries
Data Processing: Pandas, Scanpy
Version Control: Git
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
