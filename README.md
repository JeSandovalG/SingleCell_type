Project Workflow: Optimizing Cell Type Classification Using Deep Learning and Traditional Models


1Ô∏è Data Selection & Preprocessing 
Keywords: data handling, pandas, and NumPy
Data Collection
Select two large scRNA-seq datasets (200,000+ cells each) from cellxgene database.
Make sure the datasets contain diverse cell types to allow robust classification.
Select datasets with imbalanced distributions of cell types (use cases where minority classes exist).
Data Preprocessing
Perform data cleaning: normalize gene expression values (log normalization, scaling).
Perform data cleaning: filter out low-quality cells (e.g., those with excessive mitochondrial gene expression or too few expressed genes).
Perform feature selection to reduce dimensionality if needed. 
Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering
UMAP for visualization: Reduce dimensionality before clustering.
Clustering Methods:
Leuven & Leiden: Common algorithms for clustering cells before model training.
No need to annotate datasets: We are using pre-annotated datasets.

Perform Feature selection:  gene filtering (if necessary).
Annotate cell types  appropriately  
Prepare datasets for model training: 
Data Splitting 
Sampling Strategy:
Stratified Sampling: Ensure proportions of each cell type remain balanced.
GeoSketch (GeoSketch): An efficient sampling method for scRNA-seq data.

Split data into: 

Training: 60% 
Validation: 20%
Test: 20%

Reducing data points 
Reduce dataset size while preserving essential patterns.

Stratified Sampling: Reduce dataset size while preserving the distribution of cell types. Preserve essential patterns.  Ensure proportions of each cell type remain balanced.
Sampling Based on Cell Type Distribution: Ensure underrepresented cell types are not lost.
Random Sampling: Compare results with naive downsampling.
Stratified Sampling: Ensure proportions of each cell type remain balanced.
GeoSketch (GeoSketch): An efficient sampling method for scRNA-seq data.

2Ô∏è Model Implementation 

Keywords:  machine learning, deep learning frameworks, and model optimization.


Try the Traditional Method: Gradient-Boosted Trees (XGBoost)
Use XGBoost (XGBoost Docs). alternatives : LightGBM, or CatBoost.
Input: Ensure stratified data splitting to keep class proportions.
Optimize hyperparameters for the best performance.

Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Model Design 
Choose an architecture suitable for classification (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, or transformer-based models).
Implement in PyTorch.
Tune key parameters:
Dropout rate (prevents overfitting).
Learning rate (controls step size of weight updates).
Number of layers (determines depth of the model).
Number of neurons per layer (controls model complexity).
Regularization techniques (L1, L2 penalties to prevent overfitting).
Hyperparameter Optimization
Use Optuna (Optuna Docs) to find optimal DNN hyperparameters.


3Ô∏è Model Training & Monitoring
Keywords:  machine learning, model evaluation 
Logging & Performance Tracking
Neptune.ai (Neptune Docs): Track model trends and logs.
TensorBoard (TensorFlow TensorBoard): Visualize model performance over time.
PyTorch Lightning (PyTorch Lightning GitHub): Standardized training framework for PyTorch models.
Training Process
Epochs: One full pass over the entire dataset.
Mini-Batches: Model trains in small batches to improve stability.
Backpropagation: The model updates weights after each batch.
Validation Checkpoints: Monitor performance on validation data per epoch.
Train both models on:

Analyze and Interpret Results
Compare results to see how dataset reduction affects performance. 
Compare performance metrics across models and dataset sizes.
Identify trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
Provide recommendations on how much dataset size can be reduced without significant loss of accuracy.

How to Decide Who Does What?
Self-selection: Each teammate picks a role they are most comfortable with.
Rotation Strategy: If everyone wants to work on models, consider rotating roles between the first model (DNN) and the second model (GBT).
Pairing Option: If someone is less confident in a task, they can pair up with another teammate for certain tasks while still leading their main responsibility.
